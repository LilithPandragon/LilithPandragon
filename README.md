Hi! I'm **@LilithPandragon**, 
and I'm super interested in so many awesome things like *gaming*, *manga/anime*, *books/reading*,  
*mainframes*, *IoT*, *smart homes* and *smart technology*, *Raspberry Pi* and so much more! 
I'm becoming more and more of a mainframe enthusiast, and I'm really into retro technology and the history of gaming and old computers.
